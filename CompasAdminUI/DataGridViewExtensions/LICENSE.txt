DataGridView Extension Freeware Software License Agreement

 This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you ("you") and CompletIT 
for the software product DataGridView Extension ("Software"). By installing, copying, or otherwise 
using the Software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. The Software is protected by 
copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. 
The Software is licensed, not sold, and ALL SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS."


Agreement

 By using our software products you are automatically agreeing to and show that you have read and 
understood the terms and conditions contained within this Freeware Software License Agreement. This 
Freeware Software License Agreement is then effective while you use and continue to make use of these 
software products. If you do not agree with our Freeware Software License Agreement you must not use 
our software products - this Freeware Software License Agreement will then not apply to you. This 
Freeware Software License Agreement is subject to change without notice.


Freeware License Rights

 DataGridView Extension is provided free of charge. Occasionally the copyright holder may post a request 
for a donation in support of this software. This type of request does not change the classification of this 
software as freeware. Freeware software may be used as many times as you like, for as long as you like. 
You may integrate in other applications, copy and distribute copies of this program provided that you 
keep all copyright notices and disclaimers of warranty intact. You must not charge money or fees for the 
software product to anyone. You may not modify or extend the freeware to compete with us or by doing 
so help third parties to compete with us, be it for free or being paid. The copyright holder reserves the 
right to reclassify this software as a non-freeware product at a later date (i.e. shareware, licensed royalty 
software, or public domain). Doing so will not modify the license agreement of previously distributed 
executables.

You are allowed to incorporate the Software into proprietary programs.


Disclaimer of warranty on software

 You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the software is at your sole risk. The software is 
provided "as is" and without warranty of any kind and CompletIT expressly disclaims all warranties, 
express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for 
a particular purpose. CompletIT does not warrant that the functions contained in the software will meet 
your requirements, or that the operation of the software will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that defects 
in the software will be corrected. furthermore, CompletIT does not warrant or make any representations 
regarding the use or the results of the use of the software or related documentation in terms of their 
correctness, accuracy, reliability, or otherwise. No oral or written information or advice given by 
CompletIT or an authorized representative of CompletIT's shall create a warranty or in any way increase 
the scope of this warranty. Should the software prove defective, you (and not CompletIT or authorized 
representatives of CompletIT’s) assume the entire cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction. 
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not 
apply to you. The entire risk arising out of use or performance of the software remains with you.


Limitation of Liability

 Under no circumstances, including negligence, shall CompletIT or its suppliers be liable for any 
incidental, special, indirect or consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of 
business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising 
out of or relating to this license, even if CompletIT has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 
Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of incidental or consequential damages so this limitation 
may not apply to you. In no event will any copyright holder be liable to you for damages, including any 
general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program 
(including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or 
third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs). The entire risk arising out of 
use or performance of the software remains with you.
Technical Support
Technical support may be provided via e-mail and/or website postings. While every effort is made to 
provided timely technical support no guarantees whatsoever are implied that technical support will be 
provided or that technical support, when provided, will be accurate. The Software is basically 
unsupported and supplied on an as-is basis unless you have obtained a specific maintenance contract 
agreement with CompletIT.
Code distribution 
You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software except and only to the extent that 
such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation or unless given 
expressed permission.


Copyright

 All right, title and interest in and to the Software (including the copyrights in the Software and including, 
but not limited to, any images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and "applets" 
incorporated into the Software), the accompanying printed materials (if any), and any copies of the 
Software are owned by CompletIT. The Software is protected by copyright laws and international treaty 
provisions. Except as permitted by applicable law and this License, you may not modify, rent, lease, loan, 
sublicense, or create derivative works from the Software.
Any company names, logos, trademarks and product names mentioned or shown on associated website(s) 
or in software products may be copyright, trademarked or registered trademarked by their respective 
owners.


Miscellaneous

 If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision, or portion of this EULA, to be 
unenforceable, the remainder of this EULA shall continue in full force and effect. This EULA constitutes 
the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the use of the Software and supersedes all prior or 
contemporaneous understandings regarding such subject matter. No amendment to or modification of this 
EULA will be binding unless in writing and signed by CompletIT.
